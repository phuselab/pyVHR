### DATASET ###
#
# dataset: name of the module that implement the pyVHR.datasets.Dataset class. The class and the module must have the same name!
# path: path to the module where 'dataset' is defined. If 'None' then the dataset is searched inside the package datasets dir "pyVHR/datasets/".
# videodataDIR: path to the video directory of the dataset.
# BVPdataDIR: path to the ground truth BVP of the dataset.
# videoIdx: list of video ids that will be processed in the experiment. To process all the videos use '[]'.

### RGB SIGNAL ###
#
# cuda: True for using a CUDA device, False instead.
# cuda_device: which CUDA device ID to use; use 'pyVHR.utils.cuda_utils.cuda_info' for a list of your CUDA devices.
# winSize: the signal is divided into blocks/windows of size winSize (in seconds) with stride of 1 sec. ; each window will became a BPM estimate.
# tot_sec: number of seconds of the video to process; pass 0 to process the whole video.
# skin_extractor: Theese are the methods used for extracting the skin: convex-hull ('convexhull'), face-parsing ('faceparsing').
# approach: Theese are the ROI used for extracting the RGB signal: patches ('patches'), holistic ('holistic').
# patches: patch can be a square ('squares') or a rectangle('rects').
# type: 'mean' for computing the RGB signal as the RGB mean of the ROI.
# landmarks_list: a list of landmarks ids (0 to 467); a landmarks is the center of a patch; in the notebooks you can find a visual plot that shows where the landmarks are located in the face.
# squares_dim: float number that represents the pixel size of the sides of the square patches.
# rects_dims: a list of float couples [x,y], where the i_Th x,y couple represent the pixel size of the x_side and y_side of the i_Th rectangular patch.
# skin_color_low_threshold: int RGB color low threshold used for extracting the skin. This means, colors below RGB [V,V,V] are excluded, where V is the chosen int value.
# skin_color_high_threshold: int RGB color high threshold used for extracting the skin. This means, colors above RGB [V,V,V] are excluded, where V is the int chosen value.
# sig_color_low_threshold: int RGB color low threshold used for extracting the signal. This means, ROI colors below RGB [V,V,V] are excluded, where V is the chosen int value.
# sig_color_high_threshold: int RGB color high threshold used for extracting the signal. This means, ROI colors above RGB [V,V,V] are excluded, where V is the chosen int value.

### BVP ###
#
# methods: list of METHODS names.
# color_low_threshold: int RGB color low threshold used for extracting the BVP. This means, estimator's windowed-signal that has at least one value below RGB [V,V,V] is excluded, where V is the chosen int value.
# color_high_threshold: int RGB color high threshold used for extracting the BVP. This means, estimator's windowed-signal that has at least one value above RGB [V,V,V] is excluded, where V is the chosen int value.
#
# This threshold filter is only used when there are multiple estimators, so if you have chosen to use patches.
# If you don't want to lose any estimator keep this threshold range open: [0,255].
